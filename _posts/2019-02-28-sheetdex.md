title: A query tool for heterogeneous sheet music indexes

As a practicing musician, I often need to refer to sheet music when I learn a new tune. Oftentimes, I prefer to refer to multiple transcriptions of the same song in order to fine-tune my own interpretation of it. To help me locate the various transcriptions, I've created a small tool that takes a keyword and queries a meta-index, made up of various sheet music indexes I've found on the Web. The result is clumsily called [Sheetdex](https://github.com/infojunkie/sheetdex).

# Building the index
The Web has many sheet music indexes - some offered by the sheet music publishers themselves, others made by interested users like myself. Here are some of the indexes I've found:

- Jamey Aebersold has published an [index of their play-alongs up to volume 133](http://www.jazzbooks.com/jazz/free)
- Hal Leonard has published an [index of their real books](https://www.halleonard.com/search/search.action?seriesfeature=REALBK)
- [Bob Keller](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/) has compiled a [fakebook index as a Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au7yxUr1zqGNdGNidDloZ2xramV5MXB5aDg0LXlGZlE)
- Someone has compiled an [index of Guitar Techniques articles as a Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dME8bOIAJL573h4_q1RLFwHJGqG-Y4tP1jrUJZpE9mw)
- [Adam Spiers](https://github.com/aspiers) has compiled a [CSV index of music books](https://github.com/aspiers/book-indices) aimed at being incorporated into sheet music viewer apps
- Glenn Betcher had created another index of jazz standards that I could only find as PDF format (on Bob Keller's page), so I [converted it to a Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r73cqVcx_UrV01O7wb7rIj8h2X38ZLUKkn9Hc7bZ3Ao) using an [online PDF to XLS conversion service](https://www.ilovepdf.com/pdf_to_excel) (and lots of subsequent manual fixing).

The idea of integrating these different data sources into a single index requires designing a schema that unifies the information
supplied by each source, while allowing for inconsistent, missing and even conflicting data. I opted for a [simple JSON nested book-tune model](https://github.com/infojunkie/sheetdex#model) where the tune pages are explicitly stored as a named attribute, but other attributes (such as composer, tempo, tune key, etc.) are stored as "annotations" consisting of name-value pairs.

For each data source above, I created an ingestion routine that converts the source's data format to the unified model above. Once all the data soures are ingested this way, I merge book and tune data from different indexes, by matching titles using a text normalization function. An interesting tidbit I found while merging object properties is that assigning `undefined` to a property causes the corresponding object key to _disappear_ from the object. This turned out to be a handy way to reduce the code, allowing me to succintly express conditions where data may be missing:
```
sheet.page = existingSheet.page || sheet.page || undefined;
```
in which case `sheet.page` would be absent from `sheet` if neither `existingSheet.page` nor `sheet.page` are defined. Once the data is merged, the JSON index is cached to file and it is ready for querying.

# Querying the index
To simplify querying, I've opted for a [JSONPath](http://jsonpath.com/) implementation with a custom text matcher that normalizes text. This allows querying a single field in the JSON structure like `sheet.title`. The module I use allows to return a custom structure for each match, so I pluck the needed fields and return them to the caller in a JSON array.

There are problems with this approach:
- Each query traverses the full JSON index, because the fields are not individually indexed.
- To support more fields, like the author, I would need to add another JSONPath query and allow the caller to specify the field(s) to be queried.

I think I should migrate my index to a dedicated JSON database engine (like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)) but I will leave this as the proverbial "future enhancement" :wink:

# Exposing the command on the Web
To provide a UI for the tool, I've built a simple [Express](https://expressjs.com/) app that accepts a query argument, and serves the search form and the query results in a table. I've used the excellent [ag-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) to render the table, passing it the JSON query results from above verbatim. I love it when modules can just plug-in!
