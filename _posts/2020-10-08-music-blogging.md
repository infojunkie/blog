I'm interested in music blogging, to document my journey as a music learner.

Technically, I'm using is an online music host ([Musescore](https://musescore.com/infojunkie), [Flat.io](https://flat.io/karim_ratib)) to write music snippets that can be embedded within a blog like this one, using either oEmbed or an HTML embed code.

Here's one using Musecore (using embed code, [oEmbed seems broken](https://musescore.com/oembed/endpoint?url=/user/55682/scores/6383405;format=json)):

<iframe width="100%" height="394" src="https://musescore.com/user/55682/scores/6383405/embed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; fullscreen"></iframe>

And the same using Flat.io (using oEmbed):

{% oembed https://flat.io/score/5f7fccd78d188876891f5626-the-entertainer-intro  %}
