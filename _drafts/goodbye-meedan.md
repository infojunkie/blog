There are events that shape one's personal future in ways that cannot be anticipated and that lead to life-changing  experiences. I was lucky, once again, to run into one such event.

In very early 2011, big worldwide changes were afoot and I was feeling like my [Drupal consulting work](http://thereisamoduleforthat.com/) had given me a lot of self-confidence as a software craftsman, but I was yearning for more _meaningful_ engagements, where not only technical skill would be required, but that would also offer a vision to which I could contribute as a member of global society. 

A few months earlier, I had received a "quote request" on my site's contact form, saying:

> Hi Karim,

> My name is Ed Bice and I work for an NGO that has been toiling for some years now to try to create cross-language sharing on the web between Arabic and English speakers. Our goals are immodest and unreasonable but our approach is  modest and oriented toward creating an org where people like their work.  After years of working with IBM research (we actually have our own MT engine built with IBM and have a crufty custom PHP social media site at news.meedan.net) we are transitioning to a Drupal shop. We have been looking for some time for a person to join our team with a very unusual set talents- drupalist, from arab region, on west coast, interested in global issues, visual thinker, etc. A cursory look at your blog and your amazon wish list and your last fm account confirms that the most important thing I have to do today is to write a note to you. ;)  I am hoping that you might be willing to talk about our work-- we are working on two very cool projects- one with [names redacted] and the other with [names redacted]--and regardless think that it would be great to connect. Please let me know if you have time to have a call or skype or ??

> btw, totally impressed with your work/ world-view

Back to the 2011 soul-searching, I remembered this nice email and got back to Ed. Within a few weeks, I was working with Meedan on a part-time contract, coding a cool Drupal project for [inter-faith dialogue with the University of Cambridge](https://www.coexistfoundation.org/stories/launch-of-nurani). Now that's what I call meaning! Little did I know this first contract would take me on a crazy 10-year ride, working on tough technosocial problems that were barely given attention at the time - and that exploded :boom: in our collective faces since then (_cough fake news cough_). But more importantly, over these 10 years, I learned a ton about the team practice of software development, traveled to beautiful places around the globe, met incredibly interesting people, and made deep friendships and romance that will remain with me. This was not part of the official compensation package, but there's not much more I could have asked for!

# Meedan, a personal history
In Arabic, the word "meedan" (ميدان) means "public square". According to [urban design theorists](https://www.intechopen.com/books/advances-in-landscape-architecture/designing-urban-squares), some of the earliest public squares, Greek agoras, "were public spaces for all kinds of gatherings; such as political meetings, athletic and musical games, theatre performances and commercial activities". 

This is how Meedan felt at the time I joined. Led by Ed's contagious idealism and immense empathy, it was a chaotic and busy town square where wild and beautiful ideas were being pursued for their value to society, regardless of sustainability, monetizability, sometimes even feasibility! All that was needed was to find the funder who would buy into the vision and support the next project. In my then state of mind, this felt like the perfect playground, and I dove in.

I was not disappointed. To the wild ideas, I was given increasing latitude to bring software engineering rigor and grow the development team. Successful deliveries meant that bigger and more ambitious projects would get funded. Ed's extensive network kept us well connected to thinkers and shakers of the social entrepreneurship technosphere, and within a few years we were building prototypes for FAANG-level companies, in addition to programme work all over the Global South, supported by donor agencies worldwide.

The town square ethos persisted. In 2012, we hit upon our goldmine idea - "news verification" - and built a prototype over a team retreat on Crane Island, a remote location off Bellingham, Washington with intermittent electricity and no internet. We named it Checkdesk, and it [thrived for 4 years](https://github.com/meedan/checkdesk) until we replaced it in 2016 with Meedan's [current flagship product, Check](https://meedan.com/check), which is [also open source](https://github.com/meedan/check).
