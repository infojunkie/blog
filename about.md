Hello! :wave:

My name is Karim Ratib. This is my semi-professional blog as a software "craftsman", i.e. programmer, architect, tinkerer, learner, speculator, etc.

I'm also a lifelong music fan, learner and player. This will often show up on this blog as well.

I lead a fantastic team of programmers at a [great, small organization called Meedan](https://meedan.com).
We work on collaborative annotation systems for social media, applied to crowdsourced translation (notably for refugee support) and news verification.
[All our code is open sourced](https://github.com/meedan).

Before Meedan, I used to offer my [services as a Drupal programmer](http://thereisamoduleforthat.com). It was fun for many years.

I used to maintain a [blog called "Confessions of an information junkie"](http://infojunkie.karimratib.me).
